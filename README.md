# Digit-Recognition
Digit recognition involves identifying digits (0-9) from images, commonly using deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These models learn visual patterns from datasets such as MNIST, enabling applications like number plate recognition. CNNs offer high accuracy in digit classification.
